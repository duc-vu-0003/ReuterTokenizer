INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88 .
India 's national foodgrain target has been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 -LRB- Apr-Mar -RRB- , unchanged from the 1986/87 target , the Agriculture Ministry said in its annual report for 1986/87 .
Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87 due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological sub-divisions of the country .
The report gave the targets for various crops with estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following , in mln tonnes - rice 65 -LRB- 60 -RRB- , wheat 49 -LRB- 49 -RRB- , coarse grains including sorghum and millets 32 -LRB- 29 -RRB- and pulses 14 -LRB- 13 -RRB- .
Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years , it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production , signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector , the report said .
The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in fertiliser efficiency is yielding results , it said , adding total foodgrain output in 1985/86 , 1984/85 and 1983/84 respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes , 145.5 mln and a record 152.4 mln .
India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31 , 1990 .
Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes , the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes .
But the target can be achieved only with good weather , the report said .
`` The major thrust programme will , therefore , be better water -LRB- irrigation -RRB- management .
Simultaneously , efforts for spread of improved technology including timely use of inputs -LRB- farm materials like fertilisers -RRB- in adequate quantities have to be vigrously pursued , '' it said .
