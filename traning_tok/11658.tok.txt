U.S. OFFICIAL SEES EVIDENCE OF EXPORT GROWTH Beryl Sprinkel , chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers , said he sees `` growing but incomplete evidence that -LRB- U.S. -RRB- export volumes are finally strengthening . ''
In remarks prepared for a speech today in Los Angeles , Sprinkel said the decline in the dollar 's value since 1985 had `` largely '' restored U.S. cost competitiveness in world markets and appeared to signal an end to U.S. trade imbalances .
`` I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to U.S. growth in 1987 , '' he said .
