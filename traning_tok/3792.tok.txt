LICHT SEES STAGNANT EUROPEAN BEET AREA .
The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986 , West German statistician F.O. Licht said .
It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year , Licht said , but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal .
The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986 .
The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha , against 2.50 mln in 1986 .
Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln .
Individual West Europe country estimates , in 1,000 hectares -LRB- with 1986 figures in brackets -RRB- , are , Belgium/Luxembourg 114 -LRB- 118 -RRB- , Denmark 69 -LRB- 69 -RRB- , France 419 -LRB- 421 -RRB- , Greece 35 -LRB- 44 -RRB- , Ireland 36 -LRB- 38 -RRB- , Italy 270 -LRB- 275 -RRB- , Netherlands 129 -LRB- 138 -RRB- , Portugal 1 -LRB- 1 -RRB- , Spain 192 -LRB- 190 -RRB- , U.K. 200 -LRB- 201 -RRB- , West Germany 385 -LRB- 399 -RRB- , Austria 32 -LRB- 28 -RRB- , Finland 30 -LRB- 31 -RRB- , Sweden 51 -LRB- 52 -RRB- , Switzerland 15 -LRB- 14 -RRB- , Turkey 355 -LRB- 340 -RRB- , Yugoslavia 160 -LRB- 136 -RRB- .
Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows , USSR 3400 -LRB- 3440 -RRB- , Albania 10 -LRB- 9 -RRB- , Bulgaria 52 -LRB- 50 -RRB- , Czechoslovakia 195 -LRB- 196 -RRB- , East Germany 210 -LRB- 205 -RRB- , Hungary 108 -LRB- 96 -RRB- , Poland 460 -LRB- 440 -RRB- , Romania 295 -LRB- 280 -RRB- .
On the basis of average yields this year , Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes , raw value , down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87 .
Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season , thanks to favourable weather , and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88 .
Based on average yields , EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87 , while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln .
Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87 .
