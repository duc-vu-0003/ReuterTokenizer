U.S. SENATORS SEEK TO EXPAND USDA EXPORT BONUS .
Leading U.S. farm state senators are seeking to insert into the Senate 's omnibus trade bill a provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the U.S. Agriculture Department 's export enhancement program , EEP , to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products , including the Soviet Union , Senate staff said .
Under existing criteria , USDA can offer EEP subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations ' unfair trading practices .
Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy -LRB- D-Vt . -RRB-
is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be eligible for the subsidies , sources said .
The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D-Tex . -RRB-
, Max Baucus -LRB- D-Mont . -RRB-
, David Pryor -LRB- D-Ark . -RRB-
, John Melcher -LRB- D-Mont . -RRB-
and Thad Cochran -LRB- R-Miss . -RRB-
-- also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork producers and processors from Canadian imports .
The measure , sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley -LRB- R-Iowa -RRB- , would clarify the definition of `` industry '' in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers .
Grassley 's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live swine -- but not fresh , chilled and frozen pork -- were harming U.S. producers .
The bill 's proponents have argued Canada has simply replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork .
