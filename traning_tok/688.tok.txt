-LRB- RPT -RRB- U.S. SAYS TIN DISPOSALS WILL NOT AFFECT ACCORD U.S. tin disposals should have little effect on an agreement reached last weekend by tin producing countries to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1 , a government official said .
The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries -LRB- ATPC -RRB- aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices .
Following the accord , ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile .
`` We do n't think that -LRB- the U.S. government -RRB- has a large influence in the -LRB- tin -RRB- market at this stage of the game , '' said Thomas O'Donnell , Director of International Commodities at the State Department .
Last year the United States released about 4,900 tonnes of tin to two ferroalloy firms .
